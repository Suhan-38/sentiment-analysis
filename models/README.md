# Models Directory

This directory contains the pre-trained sentiment analysis models.

When you first run the application or `train_model.py`, the following files will be created here:

- `sentiment_model.pkl`: The trained Naive Bayes model
- `vectorizer.pkl`: The TF-IDF vectorizer used to transform text
- `word_sentiments.pkl`: Lists of positive and negative words for direct classification

These files are not included in the Git repository due to their size, but will be generated automatically when needed.
